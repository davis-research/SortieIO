Description: This package takes .out files generated by SORTIE-ND during
  simulation runs and converts them to CSV files that can be imported
  effectively into R. It has a pretty narrow objective, but is necessary
  to work with batch runs of SORTIE-ND. Future functionality will enable
  R-users to generate parameter files and run parameter files in SORTIE-ND
  from the R console.
