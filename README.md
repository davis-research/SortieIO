##### SortieOutputs

This is an R package for parsing SORTIE-ND summary output files (.out) into human and R- readable formats for later analysis. I am building this package because I want to complete multiple runs of models and then analyze how stable their outputs are. Also, it's a good idea, since SORTIE-ND's file i/o leaves something to be desired.
