#' sortieOutputs: A package for parsing SORTIE-ND output files
#'
#' This package provides parsing support for SORTIE-ND summary output files.
#' These output files are essentially giagantic tab-delimited files that are
#' very hard for a naive computer program to read. This package will take a
#' folder of output files and convert them into a more-readable CSV file which
#' can then be imported into R or other statistics programs for analysis.
